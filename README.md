Syntax:
Below are the detailed outline of the syntax in the backend and frontend and how each part can be modified:
1.	URLs: The URL configuration is in the "urls.py" files in the app directory. The URLs map to the views that handle the requests. You can modify the URLs to change the routing of requests to different views.
2.	Views: The views are in the "views.py" files in the app directory. The views receive the requests from the URLs and return the response to the client. You can modify the views to add new functionality or change the behavior of the application.
3.	Models: The models are in the "models.py" files in the app directory. The models represent the data stored in the database. You can modify the models to change the schema of the database.
4.	Templates: The templates are in the "templates" directory in each app directory. The templates generate the HTML pages that are served to the client. You can modify the templates to change the appearance of the application.
5.	Static files: The static files are in the "static" directory in the app directory. The static files are the CSS, JavaScript, and image files that are served to the client. You can modify the static files to change the appearance and behavior of the application.
6.	Forms: The forms are in the "forms.py" files in the app directory. The forms generate the HTML forms that are displayed to the client. You can modify the forms to add new fields or change the behavior of the application.
7.	Settings: The settings are in the "settings.py" file in the Forum directory. The settings contain the configuration for the project. You can modify the settings to change the behavior of the application.
8.	Authentication: The authentication is handled by the Django authentication system. You can modify the authentication system to add new functionality or change the behavior of the application.
